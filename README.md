**Task 1: Password Generator**

  1. **Objective:**
Create a Python password generator for generating strong, random passwords to enhance online security.

  2. **Description:**
The password generator will allow users to customize password length and character types (lowercase, uppercase, digits, symbols). It ensures randomness and adheres to security best practices.

  3. **Key Features:**
- Customizable parameters: length, character types.
- Strong randomness for security.
- User-friendly interface (CLI/GUI).
- Clipboard integration for easy copying.

 4. **Implementation:**
- Use `random` and `string` modules.
- Accept user input for parameters.
- Generate password based on selected parameters.
- Optionally copy the password to the clipboard.

**Task 2: Basic Calculator**

1. **Objective:**
Build a simple Python calculator for quick arithmetic operations.

2. **Description:**
Develop an easy-to-use calculator in Python that takes two numbers and performs basic arithmetic functions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), showing the accurate result.

3. **Key Features:**
- User-friendly design
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division support
- Input validation for numbers
- Displays the calculated result

4. **Implementation:**
- Display operation options: Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide
- Take user choice and two numbers as input
- Perform chosen operation and display the result

**Task 3: QUIZ GAME**

1. **Objective**: Create an interactive quiz game using Python to test and enhance knowledge in various subjects.

2. **Description**: Develop a user-friendly quiz game where players can choose categories, answer questions, and receive instant feedback on their performance.

3. **Key Features**:
-  Score Tracking: Keep track of players' scores and display them at the end of the quiz.
-  Multiple Choice: Questions with multiple-choice answers for interactive gameplay.
-  Correct/Incorrect Feedback: Provide immediate feedback after each question.
- High Scores: Maintain a list of high scores for competitive motivation.

4. **Implementation**:
-  Use Python's tkinter library for the GUI.
-   Store questions, options, and correct answers in data structures.
-   Implement a scoring system using variables and calculations.
